## Introduction

"Automated species identification was presented 15 years ago as a challenging but very promising solution for the development of new research activities in Taxonomy, Biology or Ecology. However, identifying a plant for a botanist means associating a scientific name to an individual plant. More precisely, that means assigning that individual plant to a group, called a taxon. Such taxon had a name selected according to a set of rules. The delimitation of taxa and the scientific names applying to them are the result of a process called taxonomy (or systematics)".[Taken from](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01913277/document)

Our project aims to create a solution that can identify a plant in an automated way. so Iâ€™m going to implement full CNN from scratch in Keras with a TensorFlow backend. This implementation will be performed on a dataset of five different kind flower. These flowers are daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower and tulip.

#### Technologies

- Python (Keras,Scikit-learn,NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib)
- Google Colab (Colaboratory)

#### CNN Architecture
![](architecture.png)

#### Required Libraries

```python
    """
      Here we are going to use Keras library 
      with tensorflow backend
    """
    import keras
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Dense, Flatten, Dropout
```
#### CNN Architecture Implementation 

```python
    model = Sequential() model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', input_shape=X_train.shape[1:], activation='relu', name='Conv2D_1'))    
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', name='Conv2D_2')) 
    model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), name='Maxpool_1')) model.add(Dropout(0.25)) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='Conv2D_3')) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', 
    name='Conv2D_4')) model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), name='Maxpool_2')) 
    model.add(Dropout(0.25)) model.add(Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='Conv2D_5')) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', name='Conv2D_6')) 
    model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), name='Maxpool_3')) 
    model.add(Flatten()) model.add(Dense(units=512, activation='relu', name='Dense_1')) 
    model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(units=128, activation='relu', name='Dense_2')) 
    model.add(Dense(units=no_of_classes, activation='softmax', name='Output'))
